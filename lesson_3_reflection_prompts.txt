When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    When more than one person are working on the same project, or you are using
    different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the code might change while you are working on a feature.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies on github and they do refer to the orignial repository. A
    clone is a exact copy of a repository with no references. You can clone a
    repository from github or from your own computer. Branches refer to
    different code in the same repository. You can make new branches or merges
    them if the feature is finished.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you are working online you could merge your work with the las known
    remote status.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I don't really know what to say here. Looks like using GitHub to
    collaborate is the best way to go.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?

    Branches are useful when you are collaborating. Workin in master can be
    simpler when you are working on your own.
