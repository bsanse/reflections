When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    When more than one person are working on the same project, or you are using
    different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the code might change while you are working on a feature.
